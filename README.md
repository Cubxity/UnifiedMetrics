## Getting started

Read the [wiki](https://github.com/Cubxity/UnifiedMetrics/wiki) for instructions.

## Data visualization and analysis

We recommend using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) as it provides highly customizable diagrams. Grafana provides
out-of-box support for Prometheus and InfluxDB.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/Cubxity/UnifiedMetrics/wiki/Grafana) for detailed instructions.

> **Note:** InfluxDB Grafana dashboard may be inaccurate due to complications with Flux queries.

### UnifiedMetrics 0.3.x (stable)

- [InfluxDB (Flux)](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14755)
- [Prometheus](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14756)

### UnifiedMetrics 0.2.x (legacy)

## Building from source

**Requirements:**

- JDK 11+
- Git (Optional)

To build UnifiedMetrics, you need to obtain the source code first. You can download the source from GitHub or use the
Git CLI.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Cubxity/UnifiedMetrics && cd UnifiedMetrics
```

Open a terminal in the cloned directory and run the following command. The following command will build all subprojects.

```bash
$ ./gradlew assemble
```

To build a specific subproject, you can prefix it with the subproject path. For example:

```bash
$ `./gradlew :unifiedmetrics-platform-bukkit:assemble`
```

The output artifacts can be found in `subproject/build/libs`.

## API

Add `:unifiedmetrics-api` as a dependency (compileOnly/provided).

```kotlin
import dev.cubxity.plugins.metrics.api.UnifiedMetricsProvider

/* ... */

val api = UnifiedMetricsProvider.get()
```

Coming soon

## Installation

- Add the plugin to your `plugins` folder.
- Configure the plugin. (See [Configuration](#Configuration)).
- Restart the server. **(NOTE: Reload is not supported and may cause issues)**

## Configuration

Currently, [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) is required to collect metrics.
We recommend using an internal network for InfluxDB.

```toml
[server]
server = "main"

[metrics]
enabled = true
driver = "influx"

[metrics.influx]
url = "http://influxdb:8086"
bucket = "unifiedmetrics"
influx = "influx"
password = "influx"
interval = 10 # Interval in seconds
```

## Data visualization and analysis
We recommend using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) as it provides highly customizable diagrams.
Grafana provides out-of-box support for InfluxDB. A guide is coming soon.
